By clicking “Create,” I (a) agree to the applicable legal terms associated with the offering; (b) authorize Microsoft to charge or bill my current payment method for the fees associated the offering(s), including applicable taxes, with the same billing frequency as my Azure subscription, until I discontinue use of the offering(s); and (c) agree that, if the deployment involves 3rd party offerings, Microsoft may share my contact information and other details of such deployment with the publisher of that offering.

Microsoft assumes no responsibility for any actions performed by third-party templates and does not provide rights for third-party products or services. See the Azure Marketplace Terms for additional terms.

Deploying this template will create one or more Azure resources or Marketplace offerings.  You acknowledge that you are responsible for reviewing the applicable pricing and legal terms associated with all resources and offerings deployed as part of this template.  Prices and associated legal terms for any Marketplace offerings can be found in the Azure Marketplace; both are subject to change at any time prior to deployment.

Neither subscription credits nor monetary commitment funds may be used to purchase non-Microsoft offerings. These purchases are billed separately.

If any Microsoft products are included in a Marketplace offering (e.g. Windows Server or SQL Server), such products are licensed by Microsoft and not by any third party.
